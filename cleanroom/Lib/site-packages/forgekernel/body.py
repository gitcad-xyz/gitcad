"""The canonical B-rep (ADR-0021) — one topology every representation maps to.

forge grew a separate solid class per feature, so every operation had to be
written once per representation: O(ops × representations), a matrix that could
never be filled. ``Body`` is the single form each of those classes converts
into, so an operation is written ONCE.

    Body  = [Face]
    Face  = (Surface, [Loop], sense)   # sense: outward normal == surface normal
    Loop  = [Edge]                     # loops[0] is the outer bound, rest holes
    Edge  = (Curve, v0, v1)            # v0 == v1 for a full circle

Surfaces and curves are ANALYTIC and EXACT — a hole is a ``Cylinder`` with a
rational radius, never a polygon fan. Nothing here approximates: mass properties
come from the divergence theorem applied per face in closed form (ℚ or ℚ[π]),
and an operation that would leave the number field refuses with its stage
(ADR-0019). Tessellation is the one deliberate exception, and only because
meshing is a display property.

    cylinder's contribution in the wrong place — a Ø10×12 cylinder comes back
    with its centre of mass at z=3 instead of z=6.

    A centre of mass is a RATIO of ℚ[π] quantities and so leaves the field
    (ADR-0019); floats are the honest boundary here, exactly as forge's other
    ``centroid_f`` do. The volume it divides by stays exact.

    ``manifold_violations`` counts how many faces use each edge. It does not
    look at DIRECTION, so a face whose loop is traversed the wrong way still
    reports every edge used exactly twice — measured, not assumed: reversing
    one face of a box gives 0 violations and this function gives (0, 0, 800).

    The identity is Gauss': for a closed surface, sum over faces of the vector
    area is the zero vector. Vector area is a BOUNDARY integral,
    ``(1/2) * contour integral of r x dr``, so it needs only the loop — no
    surface parametrisation, no area formula per surface type, and it is exact
    in Q for straight edges.

    Returns ``None`` when the check does not apply, and the caller must treat
    that as "not checked" rather than "passed". Today that means any body
    carrying a circular edge: the arc term is
    ``(1/2)[c x (p1 - p0) + r^2 * dtheta * n_hat]``, derived and exact in Q[pi]
    via the twelfth span, but it is NOT implemented here yet, and a partial sum
    would be worse than no sum — it would be nonzero for a perfectly good
    solid. So a body with any arc is skipped WHOLE.
