"""ℚ[π] as a polynomial ring — the number field a fillet needs.

``PiVal`` is ``a + bπ``, which covers every volume the kernel has computed so
far: a cylinder is πr²h, a sphere (4/3)πr³, a cone (π/3)h(r₁²+r₁r₂+r₂²). A
FILLET breaks it. Revolving a circular arc sweeps a torus, and Pappus gives

    V = 2πR · πa² = 2π²Ra

so a filleted rim needs π². More generally, Green's theorem over a profile
containing arcs produces ``∫cos²θ dθ = θ/2 + sin2θ/4``, and with θ a multiple
of π/2 that θ/2 is another power of π. There is no bound on the power in
principle, so the honest structure is the whole polynomial ring rather than one
more hand-added term.

π is TRANSCENDENTAL, so ℚ[π] is a free polynomial ring: two elements are equal
exactly when their coefficients are, and an element is zero exactly when every
coefficient is. That makes equality and zero-testing exact with no numerics at
all — the property that matters, since the charter forbids a float deciding
anything topological. Only ORDER needs evaluation, and that is done by
narrowing a rational enclosure of π until the sign is decided, which always
terminates for a nonzero element.
