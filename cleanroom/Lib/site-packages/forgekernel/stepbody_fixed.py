"""AP214 export written ONCE against the canonical B-rep (ADR-0021).

``stepio.write_step_planar_solid`` is written against one representation: a
planar ``Solid`` plus a list of z-axis ``Cyl`` bores. Everything else — a boss,
a bored boss, a bare cylinder — had no planar base to hang topology on and was
refused. That is the O(ops x reps) shape the canonical B-rep exists to remove:
a ``Body`` already knows its faces are planes and cylinders with exact
parameters, so the writer needs to know nothing about how the solid was built.

Surfaces are emitted ANALYTICALLY. A bore is a CYLINDRICAL_SURFACE that any CAD
system reads back as a hole, never a fan of facets.

Exactness (ADR-0019): STEP is a decimal interchange format, so coordinates are
rounded on the way out — that is the honest boundary of an exact export and it
decides nothing. What must NOT be approximated is topology, so the seam points
that split a periodic face are taken from the circle's own exact frame
(``c +- r*ref``), never from a float sample: both the cap and the wall then
derive bit-identical vertices and the shared edge really is shared.
